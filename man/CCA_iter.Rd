\title{ performs a (iterative) CCA on a given data table. }
\description{
This function permits user to perform fast Canonical Correlation Analysis on (high dimensional) data.  
Using stochastic processes, several estimation may be calculated depending on the user goals:
principal canonical factors, principal canonical axes, eigenvalues and correlation coefficients between the original
variables and the principal canonical factors can be computed.
If \code{stream=TRUE}, \code{CCA_iter} performs an initialisation of the function \code{\link{CCA}} : considering \code{\link[=CCA]{data_init}} observations, the function
\code{CCA_iter} calculates a first estimation of the desired elements and returns them to function \code{CCA}.
If \code{stream=FALSE}, \code{CCA_iter} performs a Canonical Correlation Analysis on the (entire) given matrix and returns the results to function \code{CCA}.
Most of the arguments of the \code{CCA} function are inherited from the \code{CCA_iter} function.

Reminding that CCA is an analysis achieved on two groups of variables only, we precise that the \code{CCA_iter} function computes the canonical elements
(principal factors, principal axes, ...) associated with the first group of variables only. If the user needs the canonical elements associated with
the second group only, he may permute the two groups of variables before launching the analysis on that new dataset. If the user needs both canonical elements
associated with the two groups, an option is to launch the \code{\link{GCCA_iter}} function (generalization of the CCA_iter function
to more than two groups) on the dataset: indeed, \code{GCCA_iter} returns the general elements (principal factors, principal axes, ...) that are strongly linked to the canonical elements: for instance, if the two groups are respectively
composed of p and q variables, the principal canonical factors associated with the first (resp. second) group returned by the CCA_iter function are of length p (resp. q) whereas 
the principal general factors returned by the GCCA_iter function are of length p+q. The principal canonical factors associated with the first (resp. second) group are 
colinears to the vectors composed of the p first (resp. q last) components of the principal general factors.

\arguments{
  \item{data}{matrix :
if \code{stream=TRUE}, \code{CCA_iter} computes a first estimation of the elements of interest on the matrix composed of the aggregation of the
\code{\link[=CCA]{data_init}} first observations;
if \code{stream=FALSE}, \code{data} is the entire given data table.
}
  \item{groups}{vector :
each component of \code{groups} gives the dimension/length of the associated group of variables.
}
  \item{stream}{boolean: stream=TRUE if you consider data streams. stream=FALSE otherwise.
}
 \item{nb_fact}{integer: number of elements to be calculated. For instance, if you need
 the three first principal canonical factors, nb_fact=3.
}
  \item{principal_factors}{ boolean : principal_factors=TRUE if you need the value of some first
principal canonical factors; principal_factors=FALSE otherwise.
}
  \item{principal_axes}{ boolean : principal_axes=TRUE if you need the value of some first
principal canonical axes; principal_axes=FALSE otherwise.
}
  \item{eigenvalues}{boolean : eigenvalues=TRUE if you need the value of some first
eigenvalues; eigenvalues=FALSE otherwise.
}
  \item{corr}{boolean : corr=TRUE if you need the value of correlation coefficient between the
original variables and some first principal canonical factors; corr=FALSE otherwise.
}
  \item{exec_time}{real : execution time. In this function, this parameter is only relevant if stream=FALSE ( if stream=TRUE, see \code{\link{CCA}} )
